||Voice & Video Calling in Flutter||

##Please follow the following steps to build your video calling app.##

1. Open with Android Studio.

2. Go to https://dashboard.agora.io/ and create your app to get an App Id.

3. Paste your app id inside settings.dart which is present inside the project you cloned in Step 1.
   Run your application.

4. Once you run your application you will see a screen asking for a channel name. 
   Just enter a random channel name which you want to create and then on other device
   running the same application join the channel by entering the same channel name over there.

   You will find that your video calling is working fine and you are now a video call with other devices.
